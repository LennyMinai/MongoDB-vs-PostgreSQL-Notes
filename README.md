Which is better? MongoDB or PostgreSQL

MongoDB : Great for flexibility, unstructured data, and high scalability. It's often used in applications requiring rapid development and real-time data.

PostgreSQL : Known for reliablity, consistency, and ACID compliance. Ideal for complex queries and structured data with strong relational support.
